## üß™ Testing Workflow

### Step 1: Upload and Process Documents
1. Go to **Document Upload** tab
2. Upload all sample files (.txt or .docx versions)
3. Set document type to "security_intelligence" or "threat_assessment"
4. Process all documents

### Step 2: Timeline Analysis Testing
1. Navigate to **üìÖ Timeline Analysis** tab
2. Verify temporal pattern extraction
3. Check timeline visualization
4. Examine monthly activity charts
5. Review key temporal entities

### Step 3: Geographic Mapping Testing
1. Navigate to **üó∫Ô∏è Geographic Mapping** tab  
2. Verify location extraction and geocoding
3. Check interactive map with markers
4. Review geographic hotspots
5. Examine country-level analysis

### Step 4: Sentiment Analysis Testing
1. Navigate to **üìä Sentiment Analysis** tab
2. Verify threat level classification
3. Check urgency scoring
4. Review sentiment distribution
5. Examine high-priority document flagging

### Step 5: Cross-Analytics Verification
1. Check **Insights Dashboard** for comprehensive view
2. Verify **Relationship Network** includes geographic entities
3. Examine **Entity Analysis** for temporal and geographic entities
4. Test export functionality for all analytics data

## üéØ Expected Results

### Timeline Analysis
- **15-20 dates** extracted across all documents
- **Monthly activity chart** showing peak activity periods
- **Temporal clusters** around major operation phases
- **Key temporal entities** ranked by importance

### Geographic Mapping
- **25+ locations** identified and geocoded
- **Interactive map** with clustered markers
- **5-10 geographic hotspots** identified
- **Country analysis** showing global distribution

### Sentiment Analysis  
- **Threat levels**: Mix of HIGH, MEDIUM, LOW classifications
- **2-3 documents** flagged as high priority
- **Urgency scores**: Range from 0.1 to 1.0
- **Sentiment distribution**: Primarily negative (intelligence context)

## üîç Advanced Testing Scenarios

### Scenario 1: Crisis Response Simulation
1. Process all documents in sequence
2. Use Timeline Analysis to understand escalation
3. Use Geographic Mapping to identify key locations
4. Use Sentiment Analysis to prioritize urgent responses

### Scenario 2: Intelligence Fusion
1. Process documents of different types (mix security/economic/threat)
2. Cross-reference entities across all analytics tabs
3. Build comprehensive intelligence picture
4. Export data for further analysis

### Scenario 3: Real-time Intelligence
1. Process "operational_update" document
2. Track real-time geographic movement
3. Analyze sentiment changes over time
4. Assess threat escalation patterns

## üí° Pro Tips

- **Geographic Mapping**: Wait for geocoding to complete (may take 30-60 seconds)
- **Timeline Analysis**: Look for patterns in monthly activity charts  
- **Sentiment Analysis**: Pay attention to high-priority document flags
- **Cross-Analytics**: Use insights from one tab to inform analysis in others
- **Export Data**: Use CSV exports for deeper analysis in external tools
